                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Athletes are the foundation of every successful training program. The best coach is an
                    experienced
                    guide
                    who begins with each athlete's hopes, dreams and desires and then tailors a training plan based
                    on
                    that
                    individual’s current fitness and lifestyle. Since 2012, GEC has helped hundreds of individuals
                    achieve
                    success in many fitness areas. The winner is not the one who finishes first but anyone who
                    starts
                    the
                    race and perseveres. Join us and begin exploring the possible.

            <q> Thank you for all that you have done. I am amazed at my progress. I realize that I have l lofty
                goals
                but
                you have me well on my way.</q><br><br>
            <q> Simal kept me focused working toward my dreams. She fosters a supportive and caring environment
                for
                growth as an athlete and as a person. Thank you!</q><br><br>
            <q> You do it right! Your track record proves it. Proud to be a GEC athlete and I'm honored to have
                you
                all
                as my coaches and support team.</q><br><br>
            <q> The coaches at GEC treat you with the highest respect: whether you're an individual getting off
                the
                couch
                for the first time or an elite athlete training for the Iron Man. They know their stuff.</q><br><br>
            <q> I just completed my first marathon, following your fitness schedule to the letter. Never once did
                I
                come
                close to bonking and two days later I felt ready for another race!</q><br><br>
